I"F<p>I want to share some beautiful quotes I learned a few days ago. All of these are from the famous novel “The Great Gatsby”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.</p>
</blockquote>

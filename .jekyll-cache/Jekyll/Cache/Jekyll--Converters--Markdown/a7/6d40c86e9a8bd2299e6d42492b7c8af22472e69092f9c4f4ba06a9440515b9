I"®<p>For one of our react project we were bound to use a third-party JS library which is totally incompatible with our React eco-system. So we were bound to use separate applications inside our React application via iframe.</p>

<p>We know Iframe seems nasty and shouldnâ€™t be there anyway, but sometimes you are bound to implement hacks when there is no other way. We were in that kind of situation.</p>

<p>The problem arose when the user started to make a change to that application and after that, we had to redirect him to our React system. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows.location</code> was of no use, which redirected us to the system, but redirecting us from the inside of the frame.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t know there is a very simple solution for this kind of nasty problem which is provided by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">window</code> API.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">window.top.location.href = https://your-desired-link.com</code></p>

<p>The above snippet came to the rescue. It will pull you out of the frame and push the URL to the URL.</p>

<p>I hope it will help you in a similar kind of situations.</p>

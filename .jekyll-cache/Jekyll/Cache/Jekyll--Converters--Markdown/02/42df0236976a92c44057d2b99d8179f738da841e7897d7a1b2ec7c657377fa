I"~<p>As part of re-instigating, the idea of Islam in my mind, have started my journey with some books from the non-muslim viewpoint. Karen Armstrong’s book has been greatly applauded by the scholars both for his lucid writing skill and joining different part of history.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a book, which will blindly slander against Islam, you are in a wrong place. Rather this book tells us a story of a religion which’s followers have tried again and again throughout history to be a just and kind nation.</p>

<p>This book demonstrates briefly the idea of politics in Islam. Why it has so much importance to the people of its followers. Why Islamic Political Party is still a thing and will always be in the future despite the continuous defamation an labeling of the western media, and ignorance of its lost and young followers.</p>

<p>It was a good start to my journey.</p>

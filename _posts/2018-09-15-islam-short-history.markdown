As part of re-instigating, the idea of Islam in my mind, have started my journey with some books from the non-muslim viewpoint. Karen Armstrong's book has been greatly applauded by the scholars both for his lucid writing skill and joining different part of history. 


If you are looking for a book, which will blindly slander against Islam, you are in a wrong place. Rather this book tells us a story of a religion which's followers have tried again and again throughout history to be a just and kind nation. 


This book demonstrates briefly the idea of politics in Islam. Why it has so much importance to the people of its followers. Why Islamic Political Party is still a thing and will always be in the future despite the continuous defamation an labeling of the western media, and ignorance of its lost and young followers. 


It was a good start to my journey.

I want to share some beautiful quotes I learned a few days ago. All of these are from the famous novel “The Great Gatsby”.

>Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.

>That’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.

>Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.

>No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.

>There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.

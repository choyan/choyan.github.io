Running 32 bit app on 64bit Ubuntu :libudev.so.0
2 Replies

A few days ago i installed two 32bit application on my 64bit elementary OS pc. Those were Koala and Haroopad. I downloaded the deb file. But both of them were failed to open after installation. So today i tried again from command line and found that one library is missing. The error message was something like this:
error while loading shared libraries: libudev.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

So i googled and found that its some kind of shared library problem on both architecture. So to solve it first try this command

sudo apt-get install libudev0:i386

This will install a 32bit version of the library. It should work. But if not, try this one

sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1.3.5 /usr/lib/libudev.so.0

This will link the missing library to one of the existed library.

Hope this will fix you problem too while trying to using these applications.
